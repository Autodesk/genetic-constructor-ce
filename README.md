# Genetic Constructor

### This project is no longer maintained.

After a year and a half working on the open source version of Genetic Constructor, we need to start working on the next evolution of the tool on a **closed-source** manner. Please feel free to use the code in this repo, but we will not continue to update it.

At a future date we intend to create a public SDK to extend the functionality provided by the application. Until then, the Autodesk Life Sciences group is accepting requests to collaborate in a more integrated manner. Please contact [geneticconstructor.maintainers@autodesk.com](mailto:geneticconstructor.maintainers@autodesk.com) if you are interested in collaborating directly with the Autodesk Life Sciences group on the project.

We encourage everyone to create an account at the Genetic Constructor Application at [https://geneticconstructor.bionano.autodesk.com](https://geneticconstructor.bionano.autodesk.com). Upon doing so, youâ€™ll also be enrolled to receive email updates on the product and our development progress.
