Actions are functions which perform mutations on the store.

Actions are a concept from [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), which explains them in great detail.

Actions in Constructor are used somewhat differently, in that they do all the heavy lifting, and may dispatch additional actions, rather than reducers.
